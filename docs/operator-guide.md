# Operator Guide

## First Deployment

1. Define the operator's dairy-shop coverage and crew intake process.
2. Define consent and purpose categories for maker/shop records.
3. Run synthetic operating cases (work-log entry, crew-operation
   scheduling, supply coordination, safety-concern flagging).
4. Enable human-reviewed sign-off for `:high`/`:safety-critical`
   actions (all flagged safety concerns, above-threshold supply
   orders).
5. Measure operating outcomes and audit coverage.

## Minimum Production Controls

- consent and disclosure log
- safety-critical escalation path (contamination risk, hygiene-
  compliance lapse, equipment condition)
- provenance for all operating records (maker and dairy shop both
  independently registered)
- human review for high-risk cases
- audit export for all gated actions
- a hard, unconditional block on any attempt to route a
  pasteurization-clearance decision, a food-safety-clearance
  decision, or a shop-safety-officer override decision, through
  this actor — those decisions stay the shop safety officer's
  exclusive authority end to end

## Certification

Certified operators must prove that the governor gates every
safety-critical robot action, that safety-critical risks escalate to
humans, and that no deployment configuration can route a
pasteurization-clearance decision, a food-safety-clearance decision,
or a shop-safety-officer judgment override through this actor.
